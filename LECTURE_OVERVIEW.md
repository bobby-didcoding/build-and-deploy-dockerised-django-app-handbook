# <span style="color:orange">Lecture overview</span>

Congratulations on reaching this pivotal section of our course! In this module, we'll dive into the practical implementation of asynchronous tasks with Celery by creating our first task: sending emails to our users. Email notification is a critical feature in most web applications, and with Celery, we can efficiently handle email sending in the background, ensuring a smooth user experience while keeping our application responsive.

Introduction to Email Sending Task: 

We'll begin by understanding the importance of asynchronous email sending and how it enhances the overall performance of our Django application. You'll learn how Celery allows us to delegate the email sending process to background tasks, reducing user wait times during the registration, password reset, or other email-related operations.

Creating the Celery Task Function: 

We'll write our first Celery task function responsible for sending emails. You'll learn how to define the task, decorate it properly, and pass necessary parameters such as the recipient's email, subject, and content.

Asynchronous Email Sending: 

With the Celery task in place, we'll execute the email sending process asynchronously in the background. You'll see how the task can be called from Django views or other parts of the application, enabling us to trigger email sending without blocking the main thread.

Monitoring Tasks: 

We'll leverage Flower, the Celery monitoring tool, to monitor the progress and status of our email sending tasks. You'll see how Flower provides insights into task execution, errors, and overall task performance.

By the end of this section, you'll have a fully functional Celery task that handles email sending efficiently in the background. You'll gain hands-on experience in integrating Celery with Django and leveraging its capabilities to streamline email-related operations.

With asynchronous email sending in place, your application will deliver a seamless and responsive user experience, ensuring that important email notifications reach your users reliably and without delay. Let's dive into the world of asynchronous tasks and make email sending a breeze in your Django application!
